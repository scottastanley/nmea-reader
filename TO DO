        
TO DO
-----
- Look at how the FileReader and InputFileDataProvider classes are implemented.  See if I can 
  define the FileReader constructor with a lambda expression with the function to call with data.
  then change InputFileDataProvider to pass the function in instead of an instance of the DP class.
  This will simplify the testing alot since I can unravel the whole CollectingDataProvider logic and 
  just pass a method in to the FileReader test with the collecting input stream.

- Cleanup
    - JavaDoc
    - push to GitHub
- look at the base classes and make the methods final that should not be extended.  
- Reevaluate the permissions on classes/methods  For instance;

- Write a sample Main method providing an example of using the NMEASentenceProvider.  Main 
   should be in a different package to insure access modifiers are okay.
- Work on project documentation on GitHub
    - Project description
    - Usage examples
    - References
- Add support for new sentence types
    - For Each
        - Add class with unit test
        - Add to properties file
        - Add a test in SentenceFactoryTest
        - Add to multiple sentence test in NMEASentenceProvider

New sentence Class
------------------
- Implement new class with unit test
- Add entry to sentences.properties
- Add test method to SentenceFactoryTest
