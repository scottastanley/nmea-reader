        
- Implement socket listener?  Maybe wait until I am on the boat again.

- Implement NMEA parsing logic
    - Add the timestamp for when the sentence was received


- NMEASentenceProvider
    - takes 1-N raw data providers
    - Sets up piped output/input for each data provider
    - Thread group of threads reading each input, parsing sentences and providing to the 
      parent sentence provider to pass on to listeners
    
- NMEASentence (base for all sentences)
- NMEASentenceFactory?  Hierarchy of them looked up by the initial tag;
      tag=5 char (IICCC)  where II = talker ID, CCC = type code
    looked up by talker ID then by three letter type code in the talker.
    
Reevaluate the permissions on classes/methods  For instance;
- public void provideData in DataProvider should probably not be public.  Making this protected is much better.
